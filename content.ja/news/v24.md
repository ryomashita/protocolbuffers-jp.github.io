The following announcements are specific to Version 24.x. For information
presented chronologically, see [News](/news).

## Stricter validation for `json_name` {#json-name}

v24 will forbid embedded null characters in the
[`json_name` field option](/programming-guides/proto3/#json).
Going forward, any valid Unicode characters will be accepted, **except**
`\u0000`. Null will still be allowed in field values.

Previously, the proto compiler allowed null characters, but support for this was
inconsistent across languages and implementations. To fix this, we are
clarifying the spec to say that null is not allowed in `json_name`, and will be
rejected by the compiler.
