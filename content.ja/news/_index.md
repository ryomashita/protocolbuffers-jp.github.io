## Per Release {#per-release}

<!-- Protobuf team: Add individual sections to a topic below when the section is
specific to a particular release, rather than a general update. -->

The following new topics provide per-release information. All News entries
appear in the chronological listing in the previous section, but only entries
that are specific to a particular version appear in the pages listed in this
section.

These pages do not replace the
[release notes](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases), as the
release notes will be more complete. Also, not everything from the chronological
listing will be in these topics, as some content is not specific to a particular
release.
