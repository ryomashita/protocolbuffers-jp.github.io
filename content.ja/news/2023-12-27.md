The following changes are planned for the 26.x line:

*   Fix `RepeatedField#each_index` to have the correct semantics.
    ([#11767](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/11767))
*   Remove Ruby DSL and associated compatibility code, which will complete the
    [migration announced in April](/news/2023-04-20).
*   `Message#to_h` fixes:
    *   Remove unset oneof fields.
        ([#6167](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/6167))
    *   Remove unset sub-message fields
*   Use message's pool for
    [`encode_json`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/2fb0b93d9de226ea96f2dc2b4779eb4712d01d5c/ruby/ext/google/protobuf_c/message.c#L1118)/[`decode_json`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/2fb0b93d9de226ea96f2dc2b4779eb4712d01d5c/ruby/ext/google/protobuf_c/message.c#L1004).

        requires UTF-8 validation.
    *   `EnumDescriptor.is_closed` to test if an enum is closed.
