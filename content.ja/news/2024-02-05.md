This topic covers breaking changes in Java, C++, and Python in the 26.x line.

## JSON Formatter Option Changes {#JSON}

Starting in the 26.x line, the JSON formatter option to print default-valued
fields is replaced with a fixed way to handle proto2 and proto3 `optional`
fields consistently.

*   Java: `includingDefaultValueFields()` is replaced with
    `alwaysPrintFieldsWithNoPresence()`.
*   C++: `always_print_default_values` is replaced with
    `always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True`.
*   Py: `including_default_value_fields=True` is replaced with
    `always_print_fields_with_no_presence=True`.

The new flag behaves identically to the old flag on proto3 messages, but no
longer applies to proto2 `optional` fields. The old flags applied to proto2
`optional` fields but not proto3 `optional` fields.
