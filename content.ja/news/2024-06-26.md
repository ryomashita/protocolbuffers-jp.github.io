## Dropping Support for Building Protobuf Java from Source with Maven

We are planning to drop support for building Protobuf Java OSS from source with
the Maven build system in the Protobuf Java 4.28 release. This has been marked
deprecated in the 4.27 release.

After this point, you can continue to use Bazel, or another build system, to
build Protobuf. You can read more about building from source in
[the Protobuf Java README](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/java).

This change may impact Protobuf Java contributors that build protobuf from
source. It does not impact the majority of users that uses the precompiled
protobuf-java or protobuf-javalite artifacts from a repository. Note
specifically that we do not plan to stop supporting the ability to compile
gencode with Maven, and we plan to continue to make prebuilt artifacts available
in the Maven Central repository.
