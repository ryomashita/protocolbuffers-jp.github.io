## Changes to Ruby Generator {#ruby}

[This GitHub PR](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/12319), which
will appear in the 23.x release, changes the Ruby code generator to emit a
serialized proto instead of the DSL.

It removes the DSL from the code generator in anticipation of splitting the DSL
out into a separate package.

Given a .proto file like:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package pkg;

message TestMessage {
  optional int32 i32 = 1;
  optional TestMessage msg = 2;
}
```

Generated code before:

```ruby
# Generated by the protocol buffer compiler.  DO NOT EDIT!
# source: protoc_explorer/main.proto

require 'google/protobuf'

Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.build do
  add_file("test.proto", :syntax => :proto3) do
    add_message "pkg.TestMessage" do
      proto3_optional :i32, :int32, 1
      proto3_optional :msg, :message, 2, "pkg.TestMessage"
    end
  end
end

module Pkg
  TestMessage = ::Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.lookup("pkg.TestMessage").msgclass
end
```

Generated code after:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true
# Generated by the protocol buffer compiler.  DO NOT EDIT!
# source: test.proto

require 'google/protobuf'

descriptor_data = "\n\ntest.proto\x12\x03pkg\"S\n\x0bTestMessage\x12\x10\n\x03i32\x18\x01 \x01(\x05H\x00\x88\x01\x01\x12\"\n\x03msg\x18\x02 \x01(\x0b\x32\x10.pkg.TestMessageH\x01\x88\x01\x01\x42\x06\n\x04_i32B\x06\n\x04_msgb\x06proto3"
begin
  Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.add_serialized_file(descriptor_data)
rescue TypeError => e
  # <compatibility code, see below>
end

module Pkg
  TestMessage = ::Google::Protobuf::DescriptorPool.generated_pool.lookup("pkg.TestMessage").msgclass
end
```

This change fixes nearly all remaining conformance problems that existed
previously. This is a side effect of moving from the DSL (which is lossy) to a
serialized descriptor (which preserves all information).

### Backward Compatibility {#backward}

This change should be 100% compatible with Ruby Protobuf >= 3.18.0, released in
Sept 2021. Additionally, it should be compatible with all existing users and
deployments.

There **is** some special compatibility code inserted to achieve this level of
backward compatibility that you should be aware of. Without the compatibility
code, there is an edge case that could break backward compatibility. The
previous code is lax in a way that the new code will be more strict.

When using a full serialized descriptor, it contains a list of all `.proto`
files imported by this file (whereas the DSL never added dependencies properly).
See the code in
[`descriptor.proto`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/dfb71558a2226718dc3bcf5df27cbc11c1f72382/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L65-L66).

`add_serialized_file` verifies that all dependencies listed in the descriptor
were previously added with `add_serialized_file`. Generally that should be fine,
because the generated code will contain Ruby `require` statements for all
dependencies, and the descriptor will fail to load anyway if the types depended
on were not previously defined in the `DescriptorPool`.

But there is a potential for problems if there are ambiguities around file
paths. For example, consider the following scenario:

```proto
// foo/bar.proto

syntax = "proto2";

message Bar {}
```

```proto
// foo/baz.proto

syntax = "proto2";

import "bar.proto";

message Baz {
  optional Bar bar = 1;
}
```

If you invoke `protoc` like so, it will work correctly:

```
$ protoc --ruby_out=. -Ifoo foo/bar.proto foo/baz.proto
$ RUBYLIB=. ruby baz_pb.rb
```

However if you invoke `protoc` like so, and didn't have any compatibility code,
it would fail to load:

```
$ protoc --ruby_out=. -I. -Ifoo foo/baz.proto
$ protoc --ruby_out=. -I. -Ifoo foo/bar.proto
$ RUBYLIB=foo ruby foo/baz_pb.rb
foo/baz_pb.rb:10:in `add_serialized_file': Unable to build file to DescriptorPool: Depends on file 'bar.proto', but it has not been loaded (Google::Protobuf::TypeError)
    from foo/baz_pb.rb:10:in `<main>'
```

The problem is that `bar.proto` is being referred to by two different canonical
names: `bar.proto` and `foo/bar.proto`. This is a user error: each import should
always be referred to by a consistent full path. Hopefully user errors of this
sort will be rare, but it is hard to know without trying.

The code in this change prints a warning using `warn` if we detect that this
edge case has occurred:

```
$ RUBYLIB=foo ruby foo/baz_pb.rb
Warning: Protobuf detected an import path issue while loading generated file foo/baz_pb.rb
- foo/baz.proto imports bar.proto, but that import was loaded as foo/bar.proto
Each proto file must use a consistent fully-qualified name.
This will become an error in the next major version.
```

There are two possible fixes in this case. One is to consistently use the name
`bar.proto` for the import (removing `-I.`). The other is to consistently use
the name `foo/bar.proto` for the import (changing the import line to `import
"foo/bar.proto"` and removing `-Ifoo`).

We plan to remove this compatibility code in the next major version.
