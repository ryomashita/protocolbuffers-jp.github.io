## Python Breaking Changes

### Removing `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` support from GitHub

In the 26.x release, `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` will no longer be present in the
`python/` directory of
[the GitHub repository](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/python)
or GitHub
[release tarballs](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). This
means it will no longer be possible to build a Python package directly from the
GitHub repo or release tarball.

The Python source packages published
[on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/#files) *will* continue to have a
`setup.py` in the top-level directory. This is the supported and recommended way
of building Python binary packages, for users who do not want to use the binary
packages that we distribute on PyPI.

For more information, see
[#15671](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/15671).
