This section contains reference documentation for working with protocol buffer
classes in C++, Java, Python, Go, C\#, Objective-C, Ruby, PHP, and Dart, as well
as some reference documentation for Protocol Buffers itself. The documentation
for each language includes (where available):

-   A reference guide to the code generated by the protocol buffer compiler from
    your `.proto` files.
-   Generated API documentation for the provided source code.

Note that there are APIs for several more languages in the pipeline -- for
details, see [Other Languages](/reference/other).
